Friend Library System

Do you have a big collection of physical media that you don't want to give up, but with others could enjoy? Have you ever borrowed a game from a friend but forgotten to give it back? Have you ever lent a friend a game and never gotten it back?

This website aims to be a system to allow you to list your physical media to your friends and allow them to place holds and borrow things for a set time, ensuring your things are enjoyed by people you trust.




Goals:
1. Create somewhat secure accounts
2. List some media with some info about that media
3. Allow adding friends
