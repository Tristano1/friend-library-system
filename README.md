Friend Library System

Do you have a big collection of physical media that you don't want to give up, but with others could enjoy? Have you ever borrowed a game from a friend but forgotten to give it back? Have you ever lent a friend a game and never gotten it back?

This website aims to be a system to allow you to list your physical media to your friends and allow them to place holds and borrow things for a set time, ensuring your things are enjoyed by people you trust.




Goals:
I want to create a system that basically does the same thing as the OPL, but with friends who can manually list their physical media.

It should allow people to list media, group it (movies, games, systems, maybe even tools and board games.)
